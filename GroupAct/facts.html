                <h1>Facts About Country Music</h1>
                <p1>It was originally called 'hillbilly music'. In the early 20th century, country music began to take hold in the southeastern states of America. It was a mix of folk songs and music from Britain, African American blues, and church music. It was usually played on instruments such as a fiddle, banjo, or acoustic guitar.</p1>
                <p2>Between the '40s and '60s, Bakersfield, California was known as the Nashville of the West as people from Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma came here looking for work and brought their music along too. The United States has more than 2,000 full-time radio stations playing only country music.</p2>
                <p3>Country music has many subgenres. Some of these are alternative country, which includes gothic country and Americana, bluegrass, including bluegrass gospel, traditional bluegrass, and progressive bluegrass, the Bakersfield sound, outlaw country, talking blues, and more.</p3>
                <p4>In the '60s, there were some musicians who recorded their tracks in such a way that the track sounded gibberish when played, but if you played the same song backwards, then you could decrypt the message of that song!</p4>
                <p5>Over time, the name changed and this style of music was known by many names, including Mountain Ballads and Old-Time Songs, Hillbilly Music in the '50s, Honky Tonk, Folk Music, Country and Western between the '30s and the '80s, and Country.</p5>
